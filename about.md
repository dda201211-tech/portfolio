About Me

My name is Darya Danilina.
I am a student from Russia. I love fencing, art, crafts, and learning languages.
I am preparing to apply to top universities in the USA and Europe by 2029.

I study online, train fencing four times a week, and develop creative projects in my free time.
On this site I will collect my achievements, projects, and progress.
